      <p> <strong>Song and Silence: A Mod for Bards and Thieves </strong>adds many options to those who use thieves and bards. It   includes a selection of items tailored to bards and thieves as well as   nine new kits. The mod works on the original Baldur's Gate II (with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion) as well as the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, and Icewind Dale. The conversion projects BGT, Tutu, and EET are also supported. For bug reports and suggestions please   visit the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/72-song-and-silence/">discussion forum</a>. </p>

    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>:   Shadows of Amn (with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal), Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, and   with the mod conversions Enhanced Edition Trilogy, Baldur's Gate   Trilogy, and Baldur's Gate Tutu. The mod is fully compatible with the   changes made in the Ashes of Embers &quot;Universal Weapons&quot; component,   provided Song and Silence is installed after it. The Rogue Rebalancing   and Refinements mods from <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/">Spellhold Studios</a> also alter rogues (bards and thieves); if you are using these then you   should get the benefits of whichever was installed most recently. Until I   get <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> (High Level Abilities) done in this mod I would recommend installing one of them before this mod, so you get their <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> and my new kits and changes to classes. All the new kits in this mod currently use the standard <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> tables so will be compatible with Refinements and Rogue Rebalancing. If   you have kitted Imoen or Nalia with the Adventurer kit from the NPC   Kitpack, installing Song and Silence's Adventurer kit will update them   to the (slightly different) S&amp;S version of the Adventurer. The Acrobat and Chorister bard kits will use the additional songs from IWDification's Bard Song component. </p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the     additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the     tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program     called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please   note   that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in   the   middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch   update (if   possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might   not be able   to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy   the whole   game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will   stay   untouched by game patches. It is important that you   install   the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in.     Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error     messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Song and Silence  for Windows is   distributed as a   self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU   installer. To install,   simply double-click   the archive and follow   the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-song_and_silence.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>song_and_silence</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-song_and_silence.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-song_and_silence.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
        Song and Silence for macOS is   distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-song_and_silence</strong>, <strong>setup-song_and_silence.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>song_and_silence</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-song_and_silence.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-song_and_silence.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Song and Silence for Linux is   distributed as a compressed   tarball and does not   include a WeiDU   installer.  Linux users will need   to do a one-time   install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall song_and_silence in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual     components, you can completely uninstall the mod using     setup-song_and_silence --uninstall at the command line to remove all     components without wading through prompts. </p>

    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Each component is separate and optional. The list of components is as follows:</p>
      <p><strong>Changes to trueclass bards and thieves, and unmodded game kits (required
        for other components)<br />
        </strong> <em>Required for all other components. </em></p>
      <p>This component changes thieves and bards to be more in line with <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> rules
        and my own personal views on the classes. Firstly, alignment restrictions
        have been changed. Thieves can now be of any alignment (previously Lawful
        Good was prohibited) as can kitless Bards and Blades. Jesters and Skalds
        can now be of any non-Lawful alignment.</p>
      <p>Secondly, this component fixes several bugs to do with bards and rogues
        in the unmodded game. These are listed below. Some of these bugs may be fixed
        by other mods/patches/fixpacks such as <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>.
        There will be no problems with having the fixes from both sources installed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Blades not actually suffering a penalty to their Pick Pockets skill as
          the description states.</li>
        <li> Skalds were not getting a bonus to hit as the description states.</li>
        <li> Swashbucklers had incorrect maximum proficiency slots in Katana, Crossbow,
          Short Bow and Sling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thirdly, thieves (kitless and kitted) can now place 3 proficiency points
        in Two Weapon Fighting Style. The Swashbuckler description has been altered
        to reflect the fact that this is now not unique to them.</p>
      <p>Further versions will include <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> changes
        - at the moment I would suggest using aVENGER's Rogue Rebalancing from <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net">Spellhold
        Studios</a> as an alternative. aVENGER has graciously allowed us to use his
        work as a basis for <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> in
        this mod, so if you've been using Rogue Rebalancing and liked that you should
        hopefully enjoy this mod too!</p>
      <p><strong>Add new bardic store and thief items</strong><br />
        <em>Not available for IWDEE</em></p>
      <p>This component adds a new storekeep, Raoul, to the game who sells a variety
        of interesting new items. These are mainly for bards but other classes may
        find something to suit as well... So be sure to take a peek. Raoul can be
        found standing between two tents at the Nashkel Carnival in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>/Tutu, and outside
        the Five Flagons at the Merchant's Square in the Athkatla Bridge District
        in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BGIIEE</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>. Note that while Raoul will appear in both the Carnival and the Bridge District in BGT games, his store inventory will not carry over from Nashkel to Athkatla. </p>
      <p>A selection of new items designed with thieves in mind has also been added;
        in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>/Tutu they can be found in the inventory of Black Lily (in the Thieves'
        Guild in the city of Baldur's Gate) and in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BGIIEE</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> you
        can find them with Roger the Fence (in the Sewers of Athkatla underneath
        the Temple District).</p>
      <p><strong>Install Acrobat bard kit</strong></p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>ACROBAT: As entertainers, most Acrobats are typically found accompanying
          carnivals or circuses, although a troupe of Acrobats can put on a remark­able
          show all by themselves. The often perform in large taverns or in clubs,
          using their arts to draw in the crowd and captivate them long enough for
          the proprietor to drain their purses. Acrobats are flashy and love to show
          off their skills; whatever they do, they like to do with a sense of style
          and a flair for the dramatic. Acrobats sometimes become cat burglars extraordinaire,
          and they are also useful adventuring allies, as they can squeeze into places
          where others cannot go without the aid of magic. Their skill at avoiding
          traps and other dangers also makes them excellent scouts.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - +1 bonus to Armor Class<br />
          - +1 bonus to Armor Class vs. missiles every 8 levels<br />
          - May place up to 2 proficiency points in slings, darts and daggers</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          - May only place proficiency points in weapons a thief can use<br />
          - May not wear armor heavier than Studded Leather<br />
          - Only has one-half normal lore value</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Install Chorister bard kit</strong></p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>CHORISTER: Music, whether hymn, symphony or dark chanting intonation,
          plays an important part in the services of most deities. For aiding in
          performing rituals or just leading the faithful in worship, most holy places
          have at least one bard, known as a Chorister.</p>
        <p>Choristers are not only to be found within temple walls, however; many
          faiths use them as missionaries, helping to bring new worshippers into
          the fold. Many an adventuring bard with a religious bent can also end up
          as a Chorister, finding their prayers answered by the deity they venerate.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - Knows a small selection of divine spells. These are accessed and memorized
          as Mage spells:<br />
          Level 1: Armor of Faith, Cure Light Wounds, Doom<br />
          Level 2: Chant, Draw Upon Holy Might, Slow Poison<br />
          Level 3: Cure Medium Wounds, Glyph of Warding<br />
          Level 4: Defensive Harmony, Holy Power<br />
          Level 5: Mass Cure<br />
          Level 6: Bolt of Glory</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          - Only has one-half normal Lore value<br />
          - Only has one-half Pick Pockets percentage</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Install Dirgesinger bard kit</strong></p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>DIRGESINGER: Dirgesingers voice melodies not of celebration and joy, but
          of sorrow and grief. They seek to spread this melancholy outlook far and
          wide, believing that only those who give in to their sadness can truly
          understand the world.</p>
        <p>These sad wanderers seek to express their grief through songs that teach
          the hearts of their listeners the meaning of true sorrow. Some of these
          fallen bards want nothing more than for others to understand the depths
          of their loss. A few are sinister creatures who believe that, since joy
          has been extinguished for them, they must in turn extinguish the joy of
          others by using their powers to teach the folly of love, the futility of
          hope, and the finality of the grave. Dirgesingers of this last sort often
          associate themselves with powerful undead; serving in the courts of vampire
          lords or lich-kings.</p>
        <p>Dirgesingers are limited to non-good alignments.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - Song Curses enemies, giving them a -1 penalty to saves and <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym><br />
          - From level 5 may use a Song of Horror 1/day. This has the same effects
          as the level 2 Wizard spell, Horror<br />
          - From level 7 may use a Song of Grief 1/day. This has the same effects
          as the level 4 Wizard spell, Confusion<br />
          - From level 9 may use a Song of Awakening 1/day. This has the same effects
          as the level 5 Wizard spell, Animate Dead</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          - Song does not improve with level<br />
          - Only has one-half normal Lore value</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Install Luring Piper bard kit</strong></p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>LURING PIPER: Luring Pipers are often employed as rat-catchers or similar vermin control specialists by townsfolk or farmers. By using their enchanting song they are able to charm their foes into traps or away from the town or farmland. However it unwise to cross a luring piper as their song can affect more than just vermin.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          -  Song charms enemies unless they save vs. spells at +2, with a -1 penalty per 5 levels of the bard<br />
          -  Has a +1 bonus to saves vs. spells per 8 levels<br />
          -  Can cast Curse once per day. The opposite of a Bless spell, this gives foes a -1 penalty to THAC0 and saves</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          -  Cannot learn mage spells from the schools of Conjuration, Invocation or Transmutation</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Install Adventurer thief kit</strong></p>
      <p> If you have kitted Imoen or Nalia with the Adventurer kit from the NPC Kitpack, installing this will update them to this version of the Adventurer. </p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>ADVENTURER: The adventurer is a jack-of-all-trades, not so much a thief as a character who takes advantage of general thiefly skills on adventures. An Adventurer is preferred by many adventuring parties, because he is much less likely than other thieves to betray or steal from his own companions. The successful Adventurer knows the value of trust and cooperation, while many a &quot;street thief&quot; has been raised on duplicity and (sometimes literal) backstabbing.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          -  +5% to Open Locks and Find/Remove Traps every other level<br />
          -  Gains a +1 bonus to all saves at levels 1, 8 and 14</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          -  No backstab multiplier</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Install Burglar thief kit</strong></p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>BURGLAR: This sort of thief is the consummate Burglar. He is an expert
          at breaking and entering the most difficult buildings, bypassing walls,
          locks, traps and guardians, grabbing the best loot, and escaping unnoticed
          as stealthily as he arrived.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - +10% to Find Traps, Hide In Shadows, Move Silently and Open Locks<br />
          - Can Specialize in Daggers, Darts, and Slings</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          - -20% to Pick Pockets and Set Traps<br />
          - Gains trap usage at half the rate of a normal thief</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Install Soulknife thief kit</strong></p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>SOULKNIFE: This sort of thief, a being possessed of potent psionic power,
          recognizes his or her own mind as the most beautiful and deadly thing in
          all creation. With practice, they have learned to forge their mental strength
          into a semisolid blade of pure psychic energy. This weapon, known as a
          mind blade, means that even when unarmed the soulknife is but a thought
          away from a deadly strike.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - Can achieve Mastery in short swords<br />
          - Can manifest a Mind Blade once per day per 10 levels. This short sword
          is a psionic weapon that lasts for 1 round/level, and counts as being of
          enchantment 1 higher than it is when determining what it can hit, to a
          maximum of +5. Each hit heals the Soulknife 1 <acronym title="Hit Point">Hit
          Point</acronym>. <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> bonus
          and damage improve by 1 per 5 levels, to a maximum of +5 at level 25. Range
          improves by 10 every 5 levels to a maximum of 50 at level 25.</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          - Cannot set traps<br />
          - Only gets 15 skill points per level</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Install Sharpshooter thief kit</strong></p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>SHARPSHOOTER: This sort of thief tends to be a stealthy character, preferring
          to engage a target from afar with bolt or arrow rather than face them
          in dangerous melee combat. Unlike the ranger, the Sharpshooter uses her skills to
          aid her dubious activities involving the property and lives of others
          rather than the protection of the great outdoors.</p>
        <p>Although well-versed in the use of many missile weapons, the sharpshooter
          is not as resilient as a true warrior and the propensity for missile attacks
          over melee means that they lack the opportunism of other thieves when it
          comes to backstabbing. They tend not to see this as a disadvantage, instead
          striking from the shadows with a well-aimed projectile, or setting a
          deadly trap for those who would follow, when necessary.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - Can attain Grand Mastery in any missile weapon a thief can use<br />
          - May coat his missile weapon in poison once per day per 4 levels. Attacks
          made with the weapon in the next round will inject the poison into the
          target, dealing out 1 damage per second for 24 seconds (3 damage for the

      <p><strong>Install Shadowdancer thief kit</strong><br />
        <em>Not available on EEs</em></p>
      <p>Since BGEE/BGIIEE/IWDEE already have their own Shadowdancer, this kit is only available for BG2/Tutu/BGT. </p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p> SHADOWDANCER: Operating in the border between light and darkness, Shadowdancers
          are nimble artists of deception. They are mysterious and unknown, never
          completely trusted but always inducing wonder when met. Despite their link
          with shadows and trickery, Shadowdancers are as often good as evil. They
          may use their incredible abilities as they wish. </p>
        <p> Shadowdancers often work in troupes, never staying in one place too long.
          Some use their abilities to entertain. Others operate as thieves, using
          their abilities to infiltrate past defenses and dupe others. All Shadowdancer
          troupes maintain an aura of mystery among the populace, who never know
          whether to think well or ill of them. </p>
        <p> Advantages: <br />
          - Gains a +5% bonus to Hide and Move Silently skills per 2 levels <br />
          - Has permanent Infravision <br />
          - May cast Reflected Image once per day <br />
          - From level 5, can summon a Shadow once per day. The Shadow increases
          in power as the Shadowdancer gains levels, has stealthy abilities, and
          is summoned for 8 hours. <br />
          - From level 8, may cast Shadow Door once per day. Further uses are gained
          at levels 14 and 20. </p>
        <p> Disadvantages: <br />
          - May not set traps <br />
          - Only gains 15 skill points per level </p>
