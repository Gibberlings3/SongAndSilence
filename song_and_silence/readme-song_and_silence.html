</div> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod adds many options to those who use thieves and bards in Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>:   Shadows of Amn (with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal) and   with the mod conversions Baldur's Gate Trilogy and  Baldur's Gate Tutu. For bug reports and suggestions please visit the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php">Gibberlings Three forums</a>. </p> 
</div> 
<h2>Compatibility</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>: Shadows of Amn (with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal) and with the mod conversions Baldur's Gate Trilogy and  Baldur's Gate Tutu. The mod is fully compatible with the changes made in the Ashes of Embers "Universal Weapons" component, provided Song and Silence is installed after it. The Rogue Rebalancing and Refinements mods from <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/">Spellhold Studios </a> also alter rogues (bards and thieves); if you are using these then you should get the benefits of whichever was installed most recently. Until I get <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> (High Level Abilities) done in this mod I would recommend installing one of them before this mod, so you get their <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> and my new kits and changes to classes. All the new kits in this mod currently use the standard <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> tables     so will be compatible with Refinements and Rogue Rebalancing. If you have kitted Imoen or Nalia with the Adventurer kit from the NPC Kitpack, installing Song and Silence's Adventurer kit will update them to the (slightly different) S&amp;S version of thhe Adventurer. </p> 
</div> 
<h2>Installation</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br /> 
    Song and Silence is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p> 
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have a <strong>"Song_and_Silence"</strong> folder and <strong>setup-song_and_silence.exe</strong> in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, double-click <strong>setup-song_and_silence.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p> 
  <p>Please run <strong>setup-song_and_silence.exe</strong> in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br /> 
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version. </em>Song and Silence is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. If properly extracted, you should have a <strong>"song_and_silence"</strong> folder, <strong>song_and_silence.tp2</strong>, <strong>setup-song_and_silence</strong>, and <strong>setup-song_and_silence.command</strong> in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, double-click <strong>setup-song_and_silence.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
	<p>	<strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall song_and_silence</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>Each component is separate and optional. The list of components is as follows:</p> 
  <p><strong>Changes to trueclass bards and thieves, and unmodded game kits (required
      for other components)<br /> 
  </strong> This is required for all other components. </p> 
  <p>This component changes thieves and bards to be more in line with <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> rules
    and my own personal views on the classes. Firstly, alignment restrictions
    have been changed. Thieves can now be of any alignment (previously Lawful
    Good was prohibited) as can kitless Bards and Blades. Jesters and Skalds
    can now be of any non-Lawful alignment.</p> 
  <p>Secondly, this component fixes several bugs to do with bards and rogues
    in the unmodded game. These are listed below. Some of these bugs may be fixed
    by other mods/patches/fixpacks such as <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>.
    There will be no problems with having the fixes from both sources installed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>  Blades not actually suffering a penalty to their Pick Pockets skill as
      the description states.</li>
    <li> Skalds were not getting a bonus to hit as the description states.</li>
    <li> Swashbucklers had incorrect maximum proficiency slots in Katana, Crossbow,
      Short Bow and Sling.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>Thirdly, thieves (kitless and kitted) can now place 3 proficiency points
    in Two Weapon Fighting Style. The Swashbuckler description has been altered
    to reflect the fact that this is now not unique to them.</p> 
  <p>Further versions will include <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> changes
    - at the moment I would suggest using aVENGER's Rogue Rebalancing from <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net">Spellhold
    Studios</a> as an alternative. aVENGER has graciously allowed us to use his
    work as a basis for <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> in
    this mod, so if you've been using Rogue Rebalancing and liked that you should
    hopefully enjoy this mod too!</p> 
  <p><strong>Add new bardic store and thief items</strong></p> 
  <p>This component adds a new storekeep, Raoul, to the game who sells a variety
    of interesting new items. These are mainly for bards but other classes may
    find something to suit as well... So be sure to take a peek. Raoul can be
    found standing between two tents at the Nashkel Carnival in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>/Tutu, and outside
    the Five Flagons at the Merchant's Square in the Athkatla Bridge District
    in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BGIIEE</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>. Note that while Raoul will appear in both the Carnival and the Bridge District in BGT games, his store inventory will not carry over from Nashkel to Athkatla. </p> 
  <p>A selection of new items designed with thieves in mind has also been added;
    in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>/Tutu they can be found in the inventory of Black Lily (in the Thieves'
    Guild in the city of Baldur's Gate) and in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BGIIEE</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> you
    can find them with Roger the Fence (in the Sewers of Athkatla underneath
    the Temple District).</p> 
  <p><strong>Install Acrobat bard kit</strong></p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p>ACROBAT: As entertainers, most Acrobats are typically found accompanying
      carnivals or circuses, although a troupe of Acrobats can put on a remark­able
      show all by themselves. The often perform in large taverns or in clubs,
      using their arts to draw in the crowd and captivate them long enough for
      the proprietor to drain their purses. Acrobats are flashy and love to show
      off their skills; whatever they do, they like to do with a sense of style
      and a flair for the dramatic. Acrobats sometimes become cat burglars extraordinaire,
      and they are also useful adventuring allies, as they can squeeze into places
      where others cannot go without the aid of magic. Their skill at avoiding
      traps and other dangers also makes them excellent scouts.</p> 
    <p>Advantages:<br /> 
      - +1 bonus to Armor Class<br /> 
      - +1 bonus to Armor Class vs. missiles every 8 levels<br /> 
      - May place up to 2 proficiency points in slings, darts and daggers</p> 
    <p>Disadvantages:<br /> 
      - May only place proficiency points in weapons a thief can use<br /> 
      - May not wear armor heavier than Studded Leather<br /> 
      - Only has one-half normal lore value</p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>Install Chorister bard kit</strong></p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p>CHORISTER: Music, whether hymn, symphony or dark chanting intonation,
      plays an important part in the services of most deities. For aiding in
      performing rituals or just leading the faithful in worship, most holy places
      have at least one bard, known as a Chorister.</p> 
    <p>Choristers are not only to be found within temple walls, however; many
      faiths use them as missionaries, helping to bring new worshippers into
      the fold. Many an adventuring bard with a religious bent can also end up
      as a Chorister, finding their prayers answered by the deity they venerate.</p> 
    <p>Advantages:<br /> 
      - Knows a small selection of divine spells. These are accessed and memorized
        as Mage spells:<br /> 
      Level 1: Armor of Faith, Cure Light Wounds, Doom<br /> 
      Level 2: Chant, Draw Upon Holy Might, Slow Poison<br /> 
      Level 3: Cure Medium Wounds, Glyph of Warding<br /> 
      Level 4: Defensive Harmony, Holy Power<br /> 
      Level 5: Mass Cure<br /> 
      Level 6: Bolt of Glory</p> 
    <p>Disadvantages:<br /> 
      - Only has one-half normal Lore value<br /> 
      - Only has one-half Pick Pockets percentage</p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>Install Dirgesinger bard kit</strong></p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p>DIRGESINGER: Dirgesingers voice melodies not of celebration and joy, but
      of sorrow and grief. They seek to spread this melancholy outlook far and
      wide, believing that only those who give in to their sadness can truly
      understand the world.</p> 
    <p>These sad wanderers seek to express their grief through songs that teach
      the hearts of their listeners the meaning of true sorrow. Some of these
      fallen bards want nothing more than for others to understand the depths
      of their loss. A few are sinister creatures who believe that, since joy
      has been extinguished for them, they must in turn extinguish the joy of
      others by using their powers to teach the folly of love, the futility of
      hope, and the finality of the grave. Dirgesingers of this last sort often
      associate themselves with powerful undead; serving in the courts of vampire
      lords or lich-kings.</p> 
    <p>Dirgesingers are limited to non-good alignments.</p> 
    <p>Advantages:<br /> 
      - Song Curses enemies, giving them a -1 penalty to saves and <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym><br /> 
      - From level 5 may use a Song of Horror 1/day. This has the same effects
      as the level 2 Wizard spell, Horror<br /> 
      - From level 7 may use a Song of Grief 1/day. This has the same effects
      as the level 4 Wizard spell, Confusion<br /> 
      - From level 9 may use a Song of Awakening 1/day. This has the same effects
      as the level 5 Wizard spell, Animate Dead</p> 
    <p>Disadvantages:<br /> 
      - Song does not improve with level<br /> 
      - Only has one-half normal Lore value</p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>Install Gypsy bard kit</strong></p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p>GYPSY: Gypsies are often called "traveling people" or "forest nomads," typically
      wandering the lands in caravans comprising of brightly painted carts or
      wagons. These people are well-known for their strange music and dances,
      typically surviving in their wandering lifestyle by entertaining villagers
      and folk in the places they roam. Gypsies wander the land, experiencing
      life as they go. They travel until they find something of interest, where
      they establish a temporary camp and remain until the urge to see more of
      the world over­powers their desire to stay. Adventuring gypsies may be
      on a personal quest to locate some unique place or thing or may simply
      be out to experience the great wonders that appear along the adventuring
      path.</p> 
    <p>Gypsies are often misunderstood by others, who classify them as thieves,
      beggars, carnival people, nomads, or any number of other erroneous names.
      They are also very open and welcoming to those who seek to learn their
      ways and join them in their wan­dering, garnering for them a reputation
      for steal­ing children in the night and then spiriting them off into the
      wilderness. It should be noted that not all Gypsies are bards or have bardic
      abilities; Gypsy bards, known among Gypsy clans as "rawuns," func­tion
      as the chief storytellers, lore-keepers, fortune tellers, and spiritual
      advisers of their Gypsy clans.</p> 
    <p>Advantages:<br /> 
      - Song charms enemies unless they save vs. spells with a -1 penalty per
        10 levels of the bard<br /> 
      - Has a +1 bonus to saves vs. spells per 8 levels<br /> 
      - Can cast Curse once per day. The opposite of a Bless spell, this gives
      foes a -1 penalty to <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> and
      saves</p> 
    <p>Disadvantages:<br /> 
      - Cannot learn mage spells from the schools of Conjuration, Invocation
        or Transmutation</p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>Install Adventurer thief kit</strong></p>
  <p> If you have kitted Imoen or Nalia with the Adventurer kit from the NPC Kitpack, installing this will update them to this version of thhe Adventurer. </p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p>ADVENTURER: The adventurer is a jack-of-all-trades, not so much a thief
      as a character who takes advantage of general thiefly skills on adventures.
      An Adventurer is preferred by many adventuring parties, because he is much
      less likely than other thieves to betray or steal from his own companions.
      The successful Adventurer knows the value of trust and cooperation, while
      many a "street thief" has been raised on duplicity and (sometimes literal)
      backstabbing.</p> 
    <p>Advantages:<br /> 
      - +5% to Open Locks and Find/Remove Traps every other level</p> 
    <p>Disadvantages:<br /> 
      - No backstab multiplier</p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>Install Burglar thief kit</strong></p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p>BURGLAR: This sort of thief is the consummate Burglar. He is an expert
      at breaking and entering the most difficult buildings, bypassing walls,
      locks, traps and guardians, grabbing the best loot, and escaping unnoticed
      as stealthily as he arrived.</p> 
    <p>Advantages:<br /> 
      - +10% to Find Traps, Hide In Shadows, Move Silently and Open Locks<br /> 
      - Can Specialize in Daggers, Darts, and Slings</p> 
    <p>Disadvantages:<br /> 
      - -20% to Pick Pockets and Set Traps<br /> 
      - Gains trap usage at half the rate of a normal thief</p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>Install Soulknife thief kit</strong></p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p>SOULKNIFE: This sort of thief, a being possessed of potent psionic power,
      recognizes his or her own mind as the most beautiful and deadly thing in
      all creation. With practice, they have learned to forge their mental strength
      into a semisolid blade of pure psychic energy. This weapon, known as a
      mind blade, means that even when unarmed the soulknife is but a thought
      away from a deadly strike.</p> 
    <p>Advantages:<br /> 
      - Can achieve Mastery in short swords<br /> 
      - Can manifest a Mind Blade once per day per 10 levels. This short sword
      is a psionic weapon that lasts for 1 round/level, and counts as being of
      enchantment 1 higher than it is when determining what it can hit, to a
      maximum of +5. Each hit heals the Soulknife 1 <acronym title="Hit Point">Hit
      Point</acronym>. <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> bonus
      and damage improve by 1 per 5 levels, to a maximum of +5 at level 25. Range
      improves by 10 every 5 levels to a maximum of 50 at level 25.</p> 
    <p>Disadvantages:<br /> 
      - Cannot set traps<br /> 
      - Only gets 15 skill points per level</p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>Install Sharpshooter thief kit</strong></p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p>SHARPSHOOTER: This sort of thief tends to be a stealthy character, preferring
      to engage a target from afar with bolt or arrow rather than face them
      in dangerous melee combat. Unlike the ranger, the Sharpshooter uses her skills to
      aid her dubious activities involving the property and lives of others
      rather than the protection of the great outdoors.</p> 
    <p>Although well-versed in the use of many missile weapons, the sharpshooter
      is not as resilient as a true warrior and the propensity for missile attacks
      over melee means that they lack the opportunism of other thieves when it
      comes to backstabbing. They tend not to see this as a disadvantage, instead
      striking from the shadows with a well-aimed projectile, or setting a
      deadly trap for those who would follow, when necessary.</p> 
    <p>Advantages:<br /> 
      - Can attain Grand Mastery in any missile weapon a thief can use<br /> 
      - May coat his missile weapon in poison once per day per 4 levels. Attacks
      made with the weapon in the next round will inject the poison into the
      target, dealing out 1 damage per second for 24 seconds (3 damage for the
      first 6 seconds). A saving throw vs. poison limits damage to 12 total.</p> 
    <p>Disadvantages:<br /> 
      - No backstab multiplier</p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>Install Shadowdancer thief kit</strong></p>
  <p>Since BGEE/BGIIEE already have their own Shadowdancer, this kit is only available for BG2/Tutu/BGT. </p> 
  <div class="kit_description"> 
    <p> SHADOWDANCER: Operating in the border between light and darkness, Shadowdancers
      are nimble artists of deception. They are mysterious and unknown, never
      completely trusted but always inducing wonder when met. Despite their link
      with shadows and trickery, Shadowdancers are as often good as evil. They
      may use their incredible abilities as they wish. </p> 
    <p> Shadowdancers often work in troupes, never staying in one place too long.
      Some use their abilities to entertain. Others operate as thieves, using
      their abilities to infiltrate past defenses and dupe others. All Shadowdancer
      troupes maintain an aura of mystery among the populace, who never know
      whether to think well or ill of them. </p> 
    <p> Advantages: <br /> 
      - Gains a +5% bonus to Hide and Move Silently skills per 2 levels <br /> 
      - Has permanent Infravision <br /> 
      - May cast Reflected Image once per day <br /> 
      - From level 5, can summon a Shadow once per day. The Shadow increases
      in power as the Shadowdancer gains levels, has stealthy abilities, and
      is summoned for 8 hours. <br /> 
      - From level 8, may cast Shadow Door once per day. Further uses are gained
      at levels 14 and 20. </p> 
    <p> Disadvantages: <br /> 
      - May not set traps <br /> 
      - Only gains 15 skill points per level </p>
